  Abstract                 = {Abstract Thermochemical energy storage can play an important role in the establishment of a reliable renewable energy supply and can increase the efficiency of industrial processes. The application of directly permeated reactive beds leads to strongly coupled mass and heat transport processes that also determine reaction kinetics. To advance this technology beyond the laboratory stage requires a thorough theoretical understanding of the multiphysics phenomena and their quantification on a scale relevant to engineering analyses. Here, the theoretical derivation of a macroscopic model for multicomponent compressible gas flow through a porous solid is presented along with its finite element implementation where solid–gas reactions occur and both phases have individual temperature fields. The model is embedded in the Theory of Porous Media and the derivation is based on the evaluation of the Clausius–Duhem inequality. Special emphasis is placed on the interphase coupling via mass, momentum and energy interaction terms and their effects are partially illustrated using numerical examples. Novel features of the implementation of the described model are verified via comparisons to analytical solutions. The specification, validation and application of the full model to a calcium hydroxide/calcium oxide based thermochemical storage system are the subject of part 2 of this study. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Thermal energy storage technologies can facilitate the transition to an energy system based largely on renewable sources and enable efficiency gains for industrial processes in general. Due to their specific advantages, various concepts of thermo-chemical storage systems are being developed. They share characteristic features of mass and heat transport that are strongly coupled through a variety of physical and chemical phenomena. To facilitate the understanding of the coupled multi-physics processes inside such systems, a versatile conceptual model for directly permeated reactive beds was developed in part 1 of this work. It was based on thermodynamic principles and the Theory of Porous Media. The model was then implemented into OpenGeoSys, a scientific finite element simulation software. In this article, the model is specified to the well-studied calcium hydroxide reaction system to illustrate its practical applicability. Sensitivity analyses reveal the influence of particle diameter, porosity, permeability, mass flux, and reaction rate. Two distinct reaction waves are identified to migrate through the reactor. The power required to pump the gas stream was decomposed into parts related to the classical mechanical pressure drop and to the chemical reaction. The results can be used for the optimization of thermochemical heat storage systems. },
